# Competitive Programming Solutions
This is a repository for solutions of popular competitive programming (CP) problems: UVa, LeetCode, Codeforces, InterviewBit and others. 

* For readability and simplicity sake, most solutions do not include competitive programming related defines and hacks. This repository is supposed to be only a reference for competitive programming solutions. Avoid copying code from here.

* As portability, compile time and executable size are not evaluated in competitive programming online judges, specific libraries are not commonly used. Usually, only the general library "bits/stdc++.h" is included, however, this should be avoided out of competitive programming code, because of the previously mentioned factors.

* Most solutions in here are implemented in C++ for efficiency and more control over memory (bit twiddling with common bit operations: and, or, xor, shifiting, complement, masking, unsigned and signed data types). Solutions in other languages can also be found but may be replaced eventually.

* Some solutions given in here may be encountered on coding interviews, however, this is not a guide. [LeetCode], [InterviewBit] and [Coding Interview University] can be cited as guides with a complete planning for coding interviews.
