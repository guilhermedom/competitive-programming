# Competitive Programming Solutions
This is a repository for solutions of popular competitive programming problems: UVa, LeetCode, Codeforces, InterviewBit and others. 

* For readability and simplicity sake, most solutions do not include competitive programming boilerplate code for defines and hacks. Specific libraries are also avoided and, usually, only "bits/stdc++.h" is included.

* Most solutions in here are implemented in C++ for efficiency and more control over memory (bit twiddling with common bit operations: and, or, xor, shifiting, complement, masking, unsigned and signed data types). Solutions in C and Python can also be found but may be replaced eventually.

* Some solutions given in here may be encountered on coding interviews, however, this is not a guide. [LeetCode], [InterviewBit] and [Coding Interview University] can be cited as guides with a complete planning for coding interviews.
