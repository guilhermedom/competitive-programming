# Competitive Programming Solutions
This is a repository for solutions of popular competitive programming (CP) problems: UVa, LeetCode, Codeforces, InterviewBit and others. 

* For readability and simplicity sake, most solutions do not include competitive programming hacks and related defines.

* This repository is supposed to be used only as a reference for competitive programming solutions. Avoid copying code from here.

* Portability, compile time and executable size are not evaluated in competitive programming online judges. Because of this, libraries that serve specific purposes, with narrow scopes, are rarely used. On the other hand, generalistic libraries, such as "bits/stdc++.h", help to speed up the coding process. These libraries are often included in the files under this repository, however, their usage should be avoided out of competitive programming code: they lack portability, increase compile time and make executables larger.

* Most solutions in here are implemented in C++ for efficiency and more control over memory (bit twiddling with bit operations: and, or, xor, shifiting, complement, masking, etc.). Solutions in other languages can also be found but may be replaced eventually.

* Some solutions given in here may be encountered on coding interviews, however, this is not a guide. [LeetCode], [InterviewBit] and [Coding Interview University] can be cited as guides with a complete planning for coding interviews.
